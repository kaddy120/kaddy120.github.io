## Good blog post. 

The internet is immense, full of all sorts of entertainment, forums, social media and your Netflix, soon it will be filled with AI-generated content. With so much content, it's easy to miss out on the good reads. Now and then one stumbles across a well-written blog post that makes one pause, think, reflect. I keep my list of those here. I could have bookmarked these posts in my browser, but I'm afraid they'll get lost in my thousand and one bookmarks
